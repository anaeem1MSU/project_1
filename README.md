# Project 1

### Group Members:

Ahmed - Renewables Vs Non-Renewables. Particulate Matter vs Respiratory Death Rate

Ben - Population vs Types of Energy Production

Bryson - CO2 Emissions vs Types of Electricity Production

John - Air Quality vs Types of Energy Production

Sristy - Air Quality vs Population

### Goal:

To analyze relationships between a countries Electricity Production, CO2 Emissions, and Air Quality. Our cleaned & merged dataset includes data from 40 different countries, spanning from 2010 to 2019.

### Datasets:
